Design and Analysis of Algorithms Laboratory Programs (18CS43)

1) Write a program to sort a given set of elements using Merge sort method and find the time required to sort the elements.
2) Write a program to sort a given set of elements using Quick sort method and find the time required to sort the elements.
3) Write a program to print all the nodes reachable from a given starting node in a graph using Depth First Search method and Breadth First method. Also check connectivity of the graph. If the graph is not connected, display the number of components in the graph.
4) Write a program to obtain the Topological ordering of vertices in a given digraph using a) Vertices deletion method b) DFS method.
5) Write a program to sort a given set of elements using Heap sort method. Find the time-complexity.
6) Write a program to implement Horspool’s algorithm for String Matching.
7) Write a program to implement 0/1 Knapsack problem using dynamic programming.
8) Write a program to find Minimum cost spanning tree of a given undirected graph using Prim’s algorithm.
9) Write a program to find the shortest path using Dijkstra’s algorithm for a weighted connected graph.
10) Write a program to find a subset of a given set S = {S1, S2,.....,Sn} of n positive integers whose sum is equal to a given positive integer d.
11) Write a program to implement N -queens problem using backtracking.
12) Write a program to solve TSP problem using branch and bound.
